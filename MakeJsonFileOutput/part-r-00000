{"asin":"\"It seems beyond the comprehension of people that someone can be born to draw comic strips,but I think I was,\" said Charles M. Schulz, creator ofPEANUTS. \"My ambition from earliest memory was to produce a daily comic strip.\" And that was exactly what Schulz did everyday sincePEANUTSdebuted in seven newspapers on October 2, 1950.Born in Minneapolis, Minnesota on November 26, 1922, Schulz was nicknamed \"Sparky\" after Barney Google's horse \"Sparkplug.\" He began his fascination with comic strips early, reading the Sunday comics from four different newspapers with his father each week. With encouragement from his father, a barber, and his mother, Schulz enrolled in a correspondence course in cartooning at what is now the Art Instruction School, Inc. in Minneapolis.His career in cartooning was interrupted in 1943 when he was drafted into the Army and soon embarked for Europe in the fight against Germany. Upon his return, Schulz landed his first job in cartooning atTimeless Topix, a Catholic comic magazine. Soon after, he took on a second job as a teacher at Art Instruction, where he worked with Charlie Brown, Linus and Frieda, who later lent their names to thePEANUTScomic strip.Schulz's first break came in 1947 when he sold a cartoon feature called \"Li'l Folks\" to theSt. Paul Pioneer Press.\"Li'l Folks\" ran as a weekly feature for two years. In 1948 he sold a cartoon panel to the Saturday Evening Post and would go on to sell 15 more panels between 1948-50.In 1950, after many mailbox rejections, Schulz boarded a train from St. Paul to New York with a handful of drawings for a meeting with United Feature Syndicate. On October 2 of that year, PEANUTS, named by the syndicate, debuted in seven newspapers. When asked if he thought the strip would be a success, Schulz replied, \"Sure, I thought it would last; in fact, when I started out I thought, 'I'll be drawing this for the rest of my life.'\"Almost 50 years later,PEANUTSappears in over 2,600 newspapers worldwide and Charles M. Schulz has become a household name. The strip has maintained its universal appeal throughout five distinctly different decades. \"As a youngster, I didn't realize how manyCharlie Brownsthere were in the world,\" said Schulz. \"I thought I was the only one. Now I realize thatCharlie Brown'sgoofs are familiar to everybody, adults and children alike.\"Schulz would work six weeks ahead on daily and Sunday strips and, unlike many cartoonists, drew every comic strip without the assistance of an art staff. He also wrote all the scripts and storyboards for thePEANUTStelevision specials, earning him five Emmy and two Peabody Awards, and was involved in all aspects of thePEANUTSpublishing and licensing programs through United Media Licensing in New York. His company, Creative Associates, was formed in 1970 to handle his business affairs and assist in maintaining the high qualitystandards associated withPEANUTS.Obviously, even after producing almost 18,000 comic strips, Schulz remained dedicated toPEANUTS. When questioned about the overwhelming devotion to his work, Schulz explained, \"Why do musicians compose symphonies and poets write poems? They do it because life wouldn't have any meaning for them if they didn't. That's why I draw cartoons. It's my life.\" Among other numerous honors, Schulz received two Reuben Awards from the National Cartoonists Society (Outstanding Cartoonist and Best Humor Strip) and was inducted into the Cartoonist Hall of Fame.Although the strip remained his first love, Schulz was an avid sports enthusiast with a long-time passion for golf (he regularly participated in the Pro Am at Pebble Beach, California). He also enjoyed tennis. Above all, he loved ice-skating and the game of hockey, and was the only non-hockey professional to be presented the coveted Lester Patrick Award for his contributions to the game. To share skating with his community, he built the Redwood Empire Ice Arena near his home in Santa Rosa, California.On February 12, 2000, Charles Schulz died in Santa Rosa, CA, of complications from colon cancer. It was only hours before his last original strip was to appear in Sunday papers. His wife, Jeannie, his five children, two stepchildren, and their families survive him.--This text refers to

{"asin":"'This is that rare thing -- a work of academic history that is also an absorbing narrative. And its great merit is to remind us that at the centre of all the dynastic wrangling, political conspiracy and media speculation stands a man who has often felt very alone.' The Economist'FOR more than 40 years a veil has been drawn over one of the most tragic episodes in the life of King Juan Carlos of Spain. Just before Easter 1956, his brother, Alfonso, 14, was shot dead with a .22 calibre pistol while the 18-year-old Juan Carlos was alone with him. The king's authorised biography made no mention of the incident. But light has been shed on it by Paul Preston, a professor at the LSE, whose biography laying bare the king's private life has reached No 1 in the Spanish bestseller lists. Preston's book has caused a furore by suggesting the future monarch may have pulled the trigger. It says he admitted to a friend he had been holding the gun at the time. The professor has given more than 60 interviews to the Spanish media and has been bombarded with hate mail and death threats.' Sunday Times, 11 May 2003'The lights and shadows of the life of Juan Carlos are reproduced with scientific precision. Preston's scalpel has been implacable... A lucid, penetrating, accurate book, backed up with an arsenal of facts... A scientifically admirable work that once more sees one of the great European historians flexing his muscles.' Luis Maria Anson, La Razon'A splendid book which, as an unauthorised biography, offers both a panoramic view of contemporary Spain as well as providing profound insight into the role of a King in the late twentieth century...

{"asin":"A glossy, predictable paean to American Jewry by the producers of the Day in the Life series, this oversize collection of photographs traverses the country, capturing cowboys and Soviet Jewry activists, magicians and roving rabbis. The belabored point here is that Jews have special customs--circumcision, bar mitzvah, Passover seder--that set them apart, but Jews are also as American as apple pie. Hence, many of the 197 pictures, most of them color, reiterate that Jews are just regular folk: there are cozy multigenerational shots and photos of Jewish doctors, astronauts, hikers, soldiers, prisoners, casket-makers, emotionally disturbed youth. Cohen, co-editor of Christmas in America , plays up a familiar ethnic focus on food and stardom (a photograph of Steven Spielberg and his mom, Leah Adler, who owns a kosher L.A. restaurant, combines the two themes).

{"asin":"A marginally educated seducer and drunk who died at 37 in 1796 remains Scotland's premier poet and songsmith. McIntyre's bicentenary biography (his last was a life of BBC founder John Reith, The Expense of Glory) is unsparing about Burns and his uneven output, from haunting lyrics to bawdy songs. Carlyle, so McIntyre writes, saw Burns's career as \"a tragedy of potential unfulfilled and opportunity squandered.\" Rather, McIntyre contends, there was scant opportunity in hardscrabble Ayrshire in Burns's time, and the flavor of that bleak life as it was actually lived is vividly evoked, as are the poet's self-defeating imprudences of every sort. Having little schooling, Burns pragmatically described his working methods as \"Untill I am compleat master of a tune, in my own singing... I can never compose for it.\" His practice was not that of the university, but it produced \"Flow gently, sweet Afton\" and \"The Cotter's Saturday Night.\" He also produced more children, illegitimate and legal, than he could afford, and left his plough for a meager salary as excise tax inspector that kept him on horseback and away from home, from the contemplative time for writing and from exploiting usefully his flair for friendship with admiring men and adoring women in circles above his class. His lyrical gift had pushed him out of the milieu that moved him to verse. As McIntyre observes, Burns's local literary reputation, once spread, \"had both made and undone him.\" He had \"an extraordinary blindness to where his own interest lay.\" Although he was \"never the slave of time,\" that became another of his many failings. McIntyre's careful scrutiny of Burns is exemplified by his quoting an exculpatory letter ostensibly done in haste. \"Pardon this confused scrawl,\" Burns explains. \"?Indeed I know not well what I have written.\" But, McIntyre notes, \"That was not strictly true?he had taken time to try his hand at a draft.\" Illustrated.Copyright 1996 Reed Business Information, Inc.","descriptionWord":["premier","and","songsmith.","McIntyre's","bicentenary","biography","(his","can","I","singing...","own","my","in","tune,","a","of","master","compleat","am","I","\"Untill","as","methods","working","his","described","pragmatically","Burns","schooling,","little","Having","sort.","every","of","imprudences","self-defeating","poet's","the","are","as","evoked,","vividly","is","lived","actually","was","it","as","life","bleak","that","of","flavor","the","and","by","his","quoting","an","exculpatory","letter","ostensibly","done","in","haste.","\"Pardon","this","confused","scrawl,\"","Burns","explains.","\"?Indeed","I","know","not","well","what","I","have","written.\"","But,","McIntyre","time,","Burns's","in","Ayrshire","hardscrabble","in","opportunity","scant","was","there","contends,","McIntyre","Rather,","squandered.\"","opportunity","and","unfulfilled","potential","of","tragedy","\"a","as","career","Burns's","saw","writes,","McIntyre","so","Carlyle,","songs.","bawdy","to","lyrics","haunting","from","output,","uneven","his","and","Burns","about","unsparing","is","Glory)","of","Expense","The","Reith,","John","founder","BBC","notes,","\"That","poet","last","was","a","life","of","Burns","of","scrutiny","careful","McIntyre's","failings.","many","his","exemplified","is","A","of","another","became","that","time,\"","of","slave","the","\"never","marginally","educated","seducer","and","drunk","who","died","at","37","in","Inc.","Information,","Business","Reed","1996","Illustrated.Copyright","draft.\"","a","at","hand","his","try","to","time","taken","had","true?he","strictly","not","was","1796","remains","Scotland's","was","he","Although","lay.\"","interest","own","his","where","to","blindness","extraordinary","\"an","had","He","him.\"","undone","and","made","both","\"had","spread,","once","reputation,","literary","local","Burns's","observes,","McIntyre","As","verse.","to","him","moved","that","milieu","the","of","out","him","pushed","had","gift","lyrical","His","class.","his","above","circles","in","women","adoring","and","men","admiring","with","friendship","for","flair","his","usefully","exploiting","from","and","writing","for","time","contemplative","the","from","home,","from","away","and","horseback","on","him","kept","that","inspector","tax","excise","as","salary","meager","a","for","plough","his","left","and","afford,","could","he","than","legal,","and","illegitimate","children,","more","produced","also","He","Night.\"","Saturday","Cotter's","\"The","and","Afton\"","sweet","gently,","\"Flow","produced","it","but","university,","the","of","that","not","was","practice","His","it.\"","for","compose","never"]}

For the next several years he accompanied the dancers on tour and, against the constant objections of the two photo-phobes, managed to record them together in rehearsal and onstage. Many of the black-and-white images included here have never been published before, and they afford both a charmingly informal glimpse of the two artists and a record of the emotional power and style that made them sellouts at the box office. Most of the photos are maddeningly uncaptioned, but one picture of Fonteyn doing her tendus in a stone archway in Athens seems innocuous enough until one reads in the accompanying text that a workman had just missed bashing her head in with a beam. In the same series, we see Fonteyn stitching a toe shoe while Nureyev looks on; the young dancer had just announced that he would not dance that night. ``Perhaps we'd better just give the money back?'' Fonteyn replied calmly, stitching away. Unfortunately, we get few such intimate anecdotes and no real understanding of their working relationship. Fonteyn was an aging star, whom the Royal Ballet management was ready to shunt aside, Money tells us. Nureyev was a fiery young dancer, a recent defector from the Soviet Union. He renewed Fonteyn's career, even dared her, according to the author, to surpass herself. The magic of that interaction is missing from Money's text. But it is very present in his photos: Fonteyn's remarkably youthful Aurora exults in the arms of Nureyev, her Prince; as Romeo and Juliet they evince innocent love tragically betrayed. Both Fonteyn and Nureyev outdanced the usual span of a dancer's career; both died too young. Money's photos and sketches remind us of the way they were. --Copyright &copy;1994, Kirkus Associates, LP.

{"asin":"American Baptist pastor, Bible teacher, and writer, Clarence Larkin was born October 28, 1850, in Chester, Delaware County, Pennsylvania. He was converted to Christ at the age of 19 and then felt called to the Gospel ministry, but the doors of opportunity for study and ministry did not open immediately. He then got a job in a bank. When he was 21 years old, he left the bank and went to college, graduating as a mechanical engineer. He continued as a professional draftsman for a while, then he became a teacher of the blind. Later, failing health compelled him to give up his teaching career. After a prolonged rest, he became a manufacturer. When he was converted he had become a member of the Episcopal Church, but in 1882,he became a Baptist and was ordained as a Baptist minister two years later. He went directly from business into the ministry. His first charge was at Kennett Square, Pennsylvania; his second pastorate was at Fox Chase, Pennsylvania, where he remained for 20 years. He was not a premillennialist at the time of his ordination, but his study of the Scriptures, with the help of some books that fell into his hands, led him to adopt the premillennialist position. He began to make large wall charts, which he titled, \"\"Prophetic Truth,\"\" for use in the pulpit. These led to his being invited to teach, in connection with his pastoral work, in two Bible institutes. During this time he published a number of prophetical charts, which were widely circulated. When World War I broke out in 1914, he was called on for addresses on The War and Prophecy. Then God laid it on his heart to prepare a work on Dispensational Truth (or God's Plan and Purpose in the Ages), containing a number of charts with descriptive matter. He spent three years of his life designing and drawing the charts and preparing the text. The favorable reception it has had since it was first published in 1918 seems to indicate that the world was waiting for such a book. Because it had a large and wide circulation in this and other lands, the first edition was soon exhausted. It was followed by a second edition, and then, realizing that the book was of permanent value, Larkin revised it and expanded it, printing it in its present form. He went to be with the Lord on January 24, 1924.\"--This text refers to thePaperbackedition.","descriptionWord":["college,","graduating","as","a","mechanical","engineer.","He","continued","as","a","professional","draftsman","for","a","while,","then","he","became","a","teacher","of","the","blind.","Later,","prolonged","a","After","career.","teaching","his","up","give","to","him","compelled","health","failing","thePaperbackedition.","to","refers","text","1924.\"--This","24,","January","on","Lord","the","with","be","to","went","He","form.","present","its","in","it","printing","it,","expanded","and","it","revised","Larkin","value,","permanent","of","was","book","the","that","realizing","then,","and","edition,","second","a","by","followed","was","It","exhausted.","soon","was","edition","first","the","lands,","other","and","this","in","circulation","wide","and","large","a","had","it","Because","book.","a","such","for","waiting","was","world","the","that","indicate","to","seems","1918","in","published","first","was","it","since","had","has","it","reception","favorable","The","text.","the","preparing","and","charts","the","drawing","and","designing","life","his","of","years","three","spent","He","matter.","descriptive","with","charts","of","number","a","containing","Ages),","the","in","Purpose","and","Plan","God's","(or","Truth","Dispensational","on","work","a","prepare","to","heart","his","on","it","laid","God","Then","Prophecy.","and","War","The","on","addresses","for","on","called","was","he","1914,","in","out","broke","I","War","World","When","circulated.","widely","were","which","charts,","prophetical","of","number","a","published","he","time","this","During","institutes.","Bible","two","in","work,","pastoral","his","with","connection","in","teach,","to","invited","being","his","to","led","These","pulpit.","the","in","use","for","Truth,\"\"","\"\"Prophetic","titled,","American","Baptist","pastor,","Bible","teacher,","and","writer,","Clarence","Larkin","was","born","October","28,","1850,","in","Chester,","Delaware","County,","Pennsylvania.","He","was","converted","to","Christ","at","the","age","of","19","and","then","felt","called","to","the","Gospel","ministry,","but","the","doors","of","opportunity","for","study","and","ministry","did","he","which","charts,","wall","large","make","to","began","He","position.","premillennialist","the","adopt","to","him","led","hands,","his","into","fell","that","books","some","of","help","the","with","Scriptures,","the","of","study","his","but","ordination,","his","of","time","the","at","premillennialist","a","not","was","He","years.","20","for","remained","he","where","Pennsylvania,","Chase,","Fox","at","was","pastorate","second","his","Pennsylvania;","Square,","Kennett","at","was","charge","first","His","ministry.","the","into","business","from","directly","went","He","later.","years","two","minister","Baptist","a","as","ordained","was","and","Baptist","a","became","1882,he","in","but","Church,","Episcopal","the","of","member","a","become","had","he","converted","was","he","When","manufacturer.","a","became","he","rest,","not","open","immediately.","He","then","got","a","job","in","a","bank.","When","he","was","21","years","old,","he","left","the","bank","and","went","to"]}

Until the 1900s, when they established themselves as \"professionals,\" doctors and lawyers accepted tips in the same manner that waiters and hairdressers do today.

{"asin":"Before titanium drivers, before oversized heads and bubble shafts, before electronic systems to tell you how far you are from the pin, golf was much the same game it is today. The lessons Harvey Penick taught in the pre-gadget days  still stand. The golf swing is basically the same, and Penick could teach it better than anybody. For most of his life, he never intended to publish hisLittle Red Book, a notebook of golf wisdom and anecdotes that he  compiled with the idea that he'd pass it on to his son. But, for the sake of history, it's a good thing that he changed his mind. Contained in its 175 pages is just about all you need to know about golf from a technical standpoint, along with Penick's priceless memories of working with famous pros, teaching absolute nobodies to get the ball in the air, and finding a horde of bat guano and hauling it across town in a pickup truck to fertilize his golf course.

{"asin":"Beryl Bainbridge seems drawn to disaster. First she tackled the  unfortunate Scott expedition to the South Pole inThe Birthday Boys; later (but emphatically pre-DiCaprio) came the sinking of the Titanic, inEvery Man for Himself. Now, in her 3rd historical novel (and her 16th overall), she takes on the Crimean War, and the result is a slim, gripping volume with all of the doomed intensity of the Light Brigade's charge--but, thankfully, without the Tennysonian bombast. \"Some pictures,\" a character confides, \"would only cause alarm to ordinary folk.\" There's a warning concealed here, and one that easily disturbed readers would do well to heed:Master Georgieis intense, disturbing, revelatory--and not always pretty to look at.Bainbridge's narrative circles round the enigmatic figure of George Hardy, a surgeon, amateur photographer, alcoholic, and repressed homosexual who counters the dissipation of his prosperous Liverpool life by heading for the Crimean Peninsula in 1854. His journey and subsequent tour of duty are told in three very different voices: Myrtle, an orphan whose lifelong loyalty to her \"Master Georgie\" becomes an overriding obsession; Pompey Jones, street urchin, fire-eater, photographer, and George's sometime lover; and Dr. Potter, George's scholarly brother-in-law, whose retreat from the war's carnage and into books takes on a tinge of madness.United by a sudden death in a Liverpool brothel in 1846, these characters plumb the curious workings of love, war, class, and fate. In between, Bainbridge frames an unforgettable series oftableaux morts: a dying soldier, one lens of his glasses \"fractured into a spider's web\"; a decapitated leg, toes \"poking through the shreds of a cavalry boot\"; two dead men \"on their knees, facing one another, propped up by the pat-a-cake thrust of their hands.\" Glimpsed as if sidewise and then passed over in language that is as understated as it is lovely, these are images that sear into the brain.Master Georgieis full of such moments, horrors painted with an exquisite brush.--Mary Park--This text refers to an out of print or unavailable edition of this title.","descriptionWord":["edition","of","this","title.","subsequent","and","journey","His","1854.","Man","for","Himself.","Now,","in","her","3rd","historical","novel","(and","her","16th","enigmatic","the","round","one","that","easily","circles","narrative","at.Bainbridge's","look","to","pretty","always","not","revelatory--and","disturbing,","intense,","Georgieis","heed:Master","to","well","do","would","readers","disturbed","overall),","she","takes","on","the","Crimean","War,","and","the","result","is","a","slim,","gripping","volume","with","all","of","the","doomed","intensity","of","the","Light","Brigade's","charge--but,","thankfully,","without","the","Tennysonian","bombast.","\"Some","pictures,\"","a","character","confides,","\"would","only","cause","alarm","to","ordinary","folk.\"","There's","a","warning","concealed","here,","and","lifelong","loyalty","to","her","\"Master","whose","orphan","an","Myrtle,","voices:","different","very","three","in","Georgie\"","becomes","an","overriding","obsession;","Pompey","Jones,","street","urchin,","fire-eater,","photographer,","and","George's","sometime","lover;","and","Dr.","Potter,","George's","scholarly","brother-in-law,","whose","retreat","from","his","of","dissipation","the","counters","who","homosexual","repressed","and","alcoholic,","the","war's","carnage","and","into","books","takes","on","a","tinge","of","madness.United","by","a","sudden","death","in","a","Liverpool","photographer,","amateur","surgeon,","a","Hardy,","George","of","figure","heading","by","brothel","in","1846,","these","characters","plumb","the","curious","workings","of","love,","war,","class,","and","fate.","told","for","the","Crimean","Peninsula","in","(but","later","Boys;","Birthday","inThe","Pole","South","the","to","expedition","Scott","unfortunate","the","tackled","she","First","disaster.","to","drawn","seems","Bainbridge","Beryl","emphatically","came","the","sinking","of","the","Titanic,","inEvery","In","between,","Bainbridge","frames","an","unforgettable","series","oftableaux","morts:","a","dying","soldier,","one","lens","of","his","glasses","\"fractured","into","a","spider's","web\";","a","decapitated","leg,","toes","\"poking","through","the","shreds","of","a","cavalry","boot\";","two","dead","men","\"on","their","knees,","facing","one","another,","propped","are","life","Liverpool","prosperous","pre-DiCaprio)","duty","of","tour","up","by","the","pat-a-cake","thrust","of","their","hands.\"","Glimpsed","as","if","sidewise","and","then","passed","over","in","language","that","is","as","understated","as","it","is","lovely,","these","are","images","that","sear","into","the","brain.Master","Georgieis","full","of","such","moments,","horrors","painted","with","an","exquisite","brush.--Mary","Park--This","text","refers","to","an","out","of","print","or","unavailable"]}

Dirk meets beautiful Eva Rojas, a World Health Organization team member inspecting a mysterious epidemic that has struck in the Sahara, when he interrupts an attempt on her life. Then the National Underwater and Marine Agency sends Pitt and Giordino up the Niger on a gunboat to find the source of a toxin that causes red tide organisms to reproduce out of control, threatening to poison the oceans and deplete the earth's oxygen supply. The pairalso in next sentence is captured by evil billionaire Yves Massarde and Mali's tyrannical despot Gen. Kazim, but they escape to find the source of the pollution at Fort Foreau, Massarde's desert toxic waste factory that receives--but doesn't dispose of--nuclear and chemical wastes. Recaptured, Pitt and Giordino are sent to Kazim's desert slave camp, where they find Eva and her team--marked for death. A deadly trek across the Sahara is their only hope. Cussler champions ecological issues with verve, and continues his love affair with history by tossing in a Confederate ironside stranded in the Sahara near the remains of an aviatrix lost during the '30s. Some judicious cutting might have improved the narrative, but it's great fun nonetheless, putting Beau Geste swashbucklers against the vilest of villains.

{"asin":"Dame Agatha Christie's prolific output of novels, short stories, and plays have sold more than 400 million copies and have been translated into 103 languages. Only the Bible and works by Shakespeare have outdistanced her. Problems at Pollensa Bay & Other Stories provides a delightful addition to this vast body of writing by \"the mistress of mystery.\" Though these eight stories are not new, several are less well known, and this audiobook represents an exciting renewal of one of the world's most popular authors. \"The Harlequin Tea Set,\" thought to be Dame Agatha's last short story, is a tale of mistaken identity and features Mr. Saterthwaite and Harley Quin, who also appear together in \"The Love Detectives,\" a little-known story about a messy love triangle.

Both Soviets and Americans race to recover the sub, which is carrying a revolutionary new superconductor, iriniump. 65 . This novel offers plenty of action, but the writing is unintentionally funny. It's hard to believe that an author could put these words into a character's mouth: \"I used to walk five miles to school in weather like this. . . . Used to say it was colder than a witch's left tit. Damned if I ever knew why the right one was warmer.\" Or this, when a polar bear approaches a female CIA agent on the ice cap: \"With a sinking feeling, Justine realized she was not alone.\" The characters are stereotypes straight from central casting, including the absent-minded professor, the evil Soviet sub commander and the beautiful female spy. Davis even manages to include two lovemaking scenes, which severely strain the credibility of his story. One of these scenes takes place in an empty torpedo tube while the father of the woman guards the couple's privacy.Copyright 1991 Reed Business Information, Inc.--This text refers to an out of print or unavailable edition of this title.","descriptionWord":["strain","severely","which","scenes,","lovemaking","two","include","to","manages","even","Davis","spy.","female","beautiful","the","and","commander","sub","Soviet","evil","the","professor,","absent-minded","the","including","casting,","central","from","straight","stereotypes","are","characters","The","alone.\"","not","was","she","realized","Justine","feeling,","sinking","a","\"With","cap:","ice","the","on","agent","CIA","female","a","approaches","bear","polar","a","when","this,","Or","warmer.\"","was","one","right","the","why","knew","ever","I","if","Damned","tit.","left","witch's","a","than","colder","was","it","say","to","Used","popularity","of","military","techno-thrillers","involves","a","Soviet","submarine","that",".",".","becomes","helplessly","frozen","in","an","arctic","ice","cap.","Both","Soviets","and","Americans","race","to","recover","the","sub,","which","is","carrying","a","revolutionary","new","superconductor,","iriniump.","65",".","This","novel","offers","plenty","of","action,","but","the","writing","is","unintentionally","funny.","It's","hard","to","believe","that","an","author","could","put","these","words","into","a","character's","mouth:","\"I","used","to","walk","five","miles","to","school","in","weather","like","this.",".","Davis's","(","Blind","Prophet",")","latest","effort","to","cash","in","on","title.","this","of","edition","unavailable","or","print","of","out","an","to","refers","text","Inc.--This","Information,","Business","Reed","1991","privacy.Copyright","couple's","the","guards","woman","the","of","father","the","while","tube","torpedo","empty","an","in","place","takes","scenes","these","of","One","the","story.","his","of","credibility","the"]}

Djinns are spirits said to be seen only after prolonged fasting and prayer; they too are integral to understanding the city. The author, a young Scot carrying on the fine British tradition of travel writing, has a knack for meeting fascinating people and capturing their most revealing remarks. He introduces us to dervishes, eunuchs, partridge fighting, weddings, and expatriates. His wife contributes sketches that nicely complement his text.

{"asin":"Dense with meaning, engagingly readable and with a universal truth at their core, these stories have the impact of well-wrought poetry. As in his novel Shoeless Joe , in which a long-deceased baseball player sets up a game in a startled fan's backyard, Kinsella's title piece explores the shifting borders of reality as Flannery O'Connor's character Enoch Emery comes to life and moves in with his creator. The stories' themes and characters are often fanciful, sometimes verging on the bizarre--the survivor of a freakish crime, as in \"Oh, Marley,\" or a man who runs off with his daughter's teenage friend in \"Evangeline's Mother\"--but in Kinsella's hands they become poignantly credible. Profiling a wife's long-buried resentments as reflected in her \"Driving Patterns,\" the author expertly sets a menacing mood. Narrated by the gunfighter's mild-mannered friend, \"Billy in Trinidad\" shows a sympathetic side of Billy the Kid. A disaffected baseball player finds true love in \"Butterfly Winter,\" a tale that evokes the magical realism of South American fiction, while a yuppie ruefully recalls his carefree '60s days and his hippie girlfriend in the endpiece, \"Mother Tucker's Yellow Duck.\"Copyright 1990 Reed Business Information, Inc.--This text refers to thePaperbackedition.","descriptionWord":["a","yuppie","ruefully","recalls","his","carefree","'60s","days","and","his","hippie","girlfriend","in","the","endpiece,","\"Mother","Tucker's","Yellow","Duck.\"Copyright","1990","Reed","Business","Information,","Inc.--This","text","refers","to","Dense","with","meaning,","engagingly","readable","and","with","a","universal","truth","at","their","core,","these","stories","have","the","impact","of","well-wrought","poetry.","As","in","his","novel","Shoeless","Joe",",","in","which","a","long-deceased","baseball","player","sets","up","a","game","in","a","startled","fan's","backyard,","Kinsella's","title","piece","explores","the","shifting","borders","of","reality","as","Flannery","O'Connor's","character","Enoch","Emery","comes","to","life","and","moves","in","with","his","creator.","The","stories'","themes","and","characters","are","often","fanciful,","sometimes","verging","on","the","bizarre--the","survivor","of","a","freakish","crime,","as","in","\"Oh,","Marley,\"","or","a","man","who","runs","off","with","his","daughter's","teenage","friend","in","\"Evangeline's","Mother\"--but","in","Kinsella's","hands","they","become","poignantly","credible.","Profiling","a","wife's","long-buried","resentments","as","reflected","in","her","\"Driving","Patterns,\"","the","author","expertly","sets","a","menacing","mood.","Narrated","by","the","gunfighter's","mild-mannered","friend,","\"Billy","in","Trinidad\"","shows","a","sympathetic","side","of","Billy","the","Kid.","A","disaffected","baseball","player","finds","true","love","in","\"Butterfly","Winter,\"","a","tale","that","evokes","the","magical","realism","thePaperbackedition.","of","South","American","fiction,","while"]}

He left school aged fourteen and worked for a number of years in the aircraft industry before embarking on an adventure - travelling to South Africa by road and supporting himself along the way by working in gold and asbestos mines. Bagley spent the Fifties in South Africa, working as a freelance journalist and critic, before moving to Italy with his wife, Margaret, and then to Guernsey. His first novel, The Golden Keel, was based on a true story overheard by Bagley in a bar in Johannesburg, about Mussolini's vast personal riches and the men who went looking for it. It was published in 1963 to great acclaim and followed by a further fifteen popular adventure ovels. Bgley's career spanned two decades and his influence can be seen in the work of several highly respected thriller writers.

Like the forerunners in the series, this one is scaled oversize to accommodate not only color photographs of avocado pasta and tomatillo soup, but also of the local landscapes, such as a Native American powwow and New Mexico's San Juan mountains. As such, Southwest can be read as a gastronomic travel book, filled with escapist textures and tastes. The book is organized by locale (e.g., the Rio Grande Basin gets one chapter) and by genre (desserts and beverages; soups, stews and chilis). It's both picturesque and practical: Kolpas sets the scene well for upscale-indigenous meals with his surveys of Southwest history and habits, while Fenzl offers practical and appealing recipes (especially for salsas and the like, and for appetizers). So while the book looks glamorous, it is also useful.Copyright 1994 Reed Business Information, Inc.","descriptionWord":["to","oversize","scaled","is","one","this","series,","the","in","forerunners","the","Like","series.","\"Beautiful\"","the","to","volume","(","Pasta","Menus",")","add","a","new","regional","of","Southwest","Passages","editor",",","who","also","runs","the","Les","Gourmettes","Cooking","School","in","Phoenix,","Ariz.,","and","food","Fenzl,","Inc.","Information,","Business","Reed","1994","useful.Copyright","also","is","it","glamorous,","looks","book","the","while","So","appetizers).","for","and","like,","the","and","salsas","for","(especially","recipes","appealing","and","practical","offers","Fenzl","while","habits,","and","history","Southwest","of","surveys","his","with","meals","upscale-indigenous","for","well","scene","the","sets","Kolpas","practical:","and","picturesque","both","It's","chilis).","and","stews","soups,","beverages;","and","(desserts","genre","by","and","chapter)","one","gets","Basin","Grande","Rio","the","(e.g.,","locale","by","organized","is","book","The","tastes.","and","textures","escapist","with","filled","book,","travel","gastronomic","a","as","read","be","can","Kolpas","Southwest","such,","As","mountains.","Juan","San","Mexico's","New","and","powwow","American","Native","a","as","such","landscapes,","local","the","of","also","but","soup,","tomatillo","and","pasta","avocado","of","photographs","color","only","not","accommodate"]}
{"asin":"Few American novels can approach the power and impact of this extraordinary work, a fictionalized autobiography by the Chinese author of Half of Man Is Woman . A harrowing account of the effects of repressive government on the individual, the novel moves between China and San Francisco, New York and Paris as its protagonist examines his own \"old-fashioned patriotism\" during a trip to the West. Central to the character's psyche are the wounds left by his attempted \"reformation\" by the Communists, a process which at one point involves his being marched to the execution ground--and left alive while those around him are killed, to wait for the rest of his life for the bullet to find him. The scene on the execution ground is unforgettable, its shocking subject filtered through a careful and farseeing irony. Although the level of the writing is generally sophisticated, the prose is occasionally self-conscious or strained--but this failing in no way impinges on the book's greatest accomplishment, its inherent refutation of its own dire assessment of China today: \"A country that cannot produce a nobility of the spirit is a country that is doomed.\"Copyright 1990 Reed Business Information, Inc.--This text refers to an out of print or unavailable edition of this title.","descriptionWord":["Man","Woman",".","A","harrowing","account","of","the","effects","of","repressive","government","on","the","individual,","the","novel","moves","between","China","and","San","title.","this","of","edition","unavailable","or","print","of","out","an","to","refers","text","Inc.--This","Information,","Business","Reed","1990","doomed.\"Copyright","is","that","country","a","is","spirit","the","of","nobility","a","produce","cannot","that","country","\"A","today:","China","of","assessment","dire","own","its","of","refutation","inherent","its","accomplishment,","greatest","book's","the","on","impinges","way","no","in","failing","this","strained--but","or","self-conscious","occasionally","is","prose","the","sophisticated,","generally","is","writing","the","of","level","the","Although","irony.","farseeing","and","careful","a","through","filtered","subject","shocking","its","unforgettable,","is","ground","execution","the","on","scene","The","him.","find","to","bullet","the","for","life","his","of","rest","the","for","wait","to","killed,","are","him","around","those","while","alive","left","ground--and","execution","the","to","marched","being","his","involves","point","one","at","which","process","a","Communists,","the","by","\"reformation\"","attempted","his","by","left","wounds","the","are","psyche","character's","the","to","Central","West.","the","to","trip","a","during","patriotism\"","\"old-fashioned","own","his","examines","protagonist","its","as","Paris","and","York","Francisco,","New","Is","Few","American","novels","can","approach","the","power","and","impact","of","this","extraordinary","work,","a","fictionalized","autobiography","by","the","Chinese","author","of","Half","of"]}

{"asin":"For fans of the Machiavellian Prime Minister Francis Urquhart, the antiheroic protagonist of Dobbs's previous trilogy (adapted for TV as House of Cards, starring Ian Richardson), Thomas Goodfellowe, a decent, down-on-his-political-luck backbencher, is an unenticing replacement. Likewise, few readers will be tempted by the second installment's ludicrous intrigue involving the Chinese government's attempts to find and kidnap the newly reincarnated, British-born Dalai Lama. A former political adviser to Margaret Thatcher and John Major, Dobbs seems to have gone soft since New Labour took power, if Goodfellowe's soap-operatic midlife crisis is an indicator. With his wife hospitalized for depression, his teenage daughter hiding family planning and pregnancy leaflets and his junior ministerial career over, Goodfellowe is totally unprepared to be enlisted by Buddhist monks in the search for the next Dalai Lama. Dobbs delivers plenty of international cat-and-mouse episodes, stretching from London's Chinatown to Tibet, along with scenes of Chinese human rights abuses that would alarm Amnesty International, but none of this adds up to much of a read. Although there are good guys to cheer for and baddies to boo in the race to find the special child in England's Tibetan refugee community, this featherweight entertainment has no punch.Copyright 1998 Cahners Business Information, Inc.","descriptionWord":["to","enlisted","by","Buddhist","monks","in","the","search","for","the","next","Dalai","Lama.","Dobbs","delivers","plenty","of","international","cat-and-mouse","episodes,","stretching","from","London's","Chinatown","to","Tibet,","along","with","scenes","of","Chinese","human","rights","abuses","that","would","alarm","Amnesty","International,","but","none","of","this","adds","up","to","much","of","a","read.","Although","there","are","good","guys","to","cheer","for","and","baddies","to","boo","in","the","race","to","find","the","special","child","in","England's","Tibetan","refugee","community,","this","featherweight","entertainment","has","no","punch.Copyright","1998","Cahners","Business","Information,","Inc.","for","hospitalized","wife","his","With","indicator.","an","is","crisis","midlife","soap-operatic","Goodfellowe's","if","power,","took","Labour","New","since","soft","gone","have","to","seems","Dobbs","Major,","John","and","Thatcher","Margaret","to","adviser","political","former","A","Lama.","Dalai","British-born","reincarnated,","newly","the","kidnap","and","find","to","attempts","government's","Chinese","the","involving","intrigue","ludicrous","installment's","second","the","by","tempted","be","will","readers","few","Likewise,","replacement.","unenticing","an","is","backbencher,","down-on-his-political-luck","decent,","a","Goodfellowe,","Thomas","Richardson),","Ian","starring","Cards,","of","House","as","TV","for","(adapted","trilogy","previous","Dobbs's","of","protagonist","antiheroic","the","Urquhart,","Francis","Minister","Prime","Machiavellian","the","of","fans","For","be","depression,","his","teenage","daughter","hiding","family","planning","and","pregnancy","leaflets","and","his","junior","ministerial","career","over,","Goodfellowe","is","totally","unprepared"]}

{"asin":"Fusing historical legend, mad scientists and shocking performance art, Scottish writer Wallace (The Pied Piper's Poison) has crafted an unsettling tale of menace set during Edinburgh's Fringe Festival. In the early 1800s, expositional scientist Dr. Alexander Brodie is busy developing a heinous device that extracts and preserves the souls of unsuspecting victims (many dug up from graves) for future use in experiments on other patients. Fast-forward to 1999, where this same device turns up being tested in public at showman Peter Dexter's \"Resurrectionist Expression\" performance, much to the horror of young Charles Kidd, Dexter's public relations guru. Dexter's shadowy display of \"studied theatrics\" quickly backfires when the crowd angrily overtakes the stage after several audience members lose consciousness and vanish. Running parallel is an eerie, captivating transcribed interview with Daniel Lowes, who attends Dexter's resurrectionist festival performance. He describes dizzying, nightlong heavy drug use, sex, mystery and graveyard antics, which, joined with the other dangling plot pieces, concludes with a surprisingly cohesive explosion. Not all of the narrative sparkles. Wallace scatters dull legal briefs , which contribute little more than a different font style. He has a vivid imagination, and his story intermingles the curious history of Edinburgh's underbelly of grave robbers and medical mischief with some present-day grotesqueries, but the many scattered subplots limit the potential for a truly chilling experience.Copyright 2001 Cahners Business Information, Inc.--This text refers to an out of print or unavailable edition of this title.","descriptionWord":["has","Poison)","Piper's","Pied","(The","Wallace","writer","Scottish","art,","performance","Fusing","historical","legend,","mad","scientists","and","shocking","title.","this","of","edition","unavailable","or","print","of","out","an","to","refers","text","Inc.--This","Information,","Business","Cahners","2001","experience.Copyright","chilling","truly","a","for","potential","the","limit","subplots","scattered","many","the","but","grotesqueries,","present-day","some","with","mischief","medical","and","robbers","grave","of","underbelly","Edinburgh's","of","history","curious","the","intermingles","story","his","and","imagination,","vivid","a","has","He","style.","font","different","a","than","more","little","contribute","which",",","briefs","legal","dull","scatters","Wallace","sparkles.","narrative","the","of","all","Not","explosion.","cohesive","surprisingly","a","with","concludes","pieces,","plot","dangling","other","the","with","joined","which,","antics,","graveyard","and","mystery","sex,","use,","drug","heavy","nightlong","dizzying,","describes","He","performance.","festival","resurrectionist","Dexter's","attends","who","Lowes,","Daniel","with","interview","transcribed","captivating","eerie,","an","is","parallel","Running","vanish.","and","consciousness","lose","members","audience","several","after","stage","the","overtakes","angrily","crowd","the","when","backfires","quickly","theatrics\"","\"studied","of","display","shadowy","Dexter's","guru.","relations","public","Dexter's","Kidd,","Charles","young","of","horror","the","to","much","performance,","Expression\"","\"Resurrectionist","Dexter's","Peter","showman","at","public","in","tested","being","up","turns","device","same","this","where","1999,","to","Fast-forward","patients.","other","on","experiments","in","use","future","for","graves)","from","up","dug","(many","victims","unsuspecting","of","souls","the","preserves","and","extracts","that","device","heinous","a","developing","busy","is","Brodie","Alexander","Dr.","scientist","expositional","1800s,","early","the","In","Festival.","Fringe","Edinburgh's","during","set","menace","of","tale","unsettling","an","crafted"]}

{"asin":"Grade 3-6-In this fast-paced fantasy, a neglected wooden horse is changed back into the beautiful mare it once was, through the loving care of a shy, lonely, preadolescent girl. Irina sees the old rocking horse in a junkstore window and decides she must have it. The proprietor, sensing her need for it, gives Bella to her, and tells her about a live Bella, a beautiful, once-wild horse that used to belong to a local farmer who mistreated her. As the wooden horse gradually comes to life, Irina blossoms. She is happier than she has ever been, especially when her Bella takes her on thrilling midnight rides. One cold winter night, the animal leaves the child to run through the hills with a herd of wild horses. Irina is devastated. Too late she realizes she has not heeded the storekeeper's warning \"Never say that any creature on this earth is yours....\" She withdraws into herself again-until Bella returns, bringing her injured foal for Irina to nurse. This time she promises herself to let it go when it is grown. In so doing, she frees herself to grow up. The message may seem obvious to some, but that will not deter young horse lovers and beginning readers of fantasy, who will be absorbed by the details of equistrian care, the magic of the animal's transformation, and the excitement of the late-night rides. The many fine black-and-white drawings convey Irina's sadness, Bella's magical changes, and the strong energy of the galloping horses.Virginia Golodetz, St. Michael's College, Winooski, VTCopyright 1993 Reed Business Information, Inc.--This text refers to an out of print or unavailable edition of this title.","descriptionWord":["back","changed","is","horse","wooden","neglected","a","fantasy,","fast-paced","this","3-6-In","a","junkstore","window","and","decides","she","must","have","it.","The","proprietor,","sensing","her","need","for","it,","gives","Bella","to","Grade","life,","Irina","blossoms.","She","is","happier","than","she","has","ever","been,","especially","when","her","Bella","takes","her","on","thrilling","midnight","rides.","One","cold","title.","this","of","edition","unavailable","or","print","of","out","an","to","refers","text","Inc.--This","Information,","Business","Reed","1993","VTCopyright","Winooski,","College,","Michael's","St.","Golodetz,","horses.Virginia","galloping","the","of","energy","strong","the","and","changes,","magical","Bella's","sadness,","Irina's","convey","drawings","black-and-white","fine","many","The","rides.","late-night","the","of","excitement","the","and","transformation,","animal's","the","of","magic","the","care,","equistrian","of","details","the","by","absorbed","be","will","who","fantasy,","of","readers","beginning","and","lovers","horse","young","deter","not","will","that","but","some,","to","it","once","was,","obvious","seem","may","message","The","up.","grow","to","in","horse","rocking","old","the","sees","Irina","girl.","preadolescent","lonely,","shy,","a","of","care","loving","the","through","herself","frees","she","doing,","so","In","grown.","is","it","when","go","it","let","to","herself","promises","she","time","This","nurse.","to","Irina","for","foal","injured","her","bringing","returns,","Bella","again-until","herself","into","withdraws","She","yours....\"","is","earth","this","on","creature","any","that","say","\"Never","warning","storekeeper's","the","heeded","not","has","she","realizes","she","late","Too","devastated.","the","through","run","to","child","the","leaves","animal","the","night,","winter","is","Irina","horses.","wild","of","herd","a","with","hills","mare","beautiful","the","into","to","comes","gradually","horse","wooden","the","As","her.","mistreated","who","farmer","local","a","to","belong","to","used","that","horse","once-wild","beautiful,","a","Bella,","live","a","about","her","tells","and","her,"]}
{"asin":"Grade 7&#8211;10&#8212;San Francisco Soames has never had a \"normal\" family. He and his siblings are named after places, his twin sisters are always getting into trouble, and his parents are former hippies. But things take a turn for the worse in their small Vermont town when his parents inform him that his father is gay. A homophobic bullying incident outside a pharmacy, in which the store's owner attempts to protect Cisco with a shotgun, turns ugly and the next thing Cisco knows, he's responsible for putting Mr. Patterson in a coma. In an attempt to give their son a fresh start, the boy's parents send him to his Uncle Vincent's ranch in middle-of-nowhere British Columbia, but Cisco's fate doesn't immediately improve upon landing on Canadian soil. He appreciates cooking and eating good food, but his uncle's moose stew is barely edible. Belgue excels at capturing the realities of small-town life. Likewise, details of the Canadian wilderness will make readers feel transported to the great white North. Unfortunately, the story suffers from uneven pacing and characters who never quite come to life. While Cisco's cooking aspirations could draw an audience, they are not a large enough part of the story and fail to carry it. Given the dearth of YA fiction featuring gay parents, this title is significant. However, the Canadian setting and other shortcomings make it a hard sell.&#8212;Jennifer Barnes, Gleason Public Library, Carlisle, MA(c) Copyright 2011. &#xA0;Library Journals LLC, a wholly owned subsidiary of Media Source, Inc.

{"asin":"Great granddaughter to Charles Dickens, Monica (1915-1992) was born into an upper middle class family. Disillusioned with the world in which she was brought up, she acted out - she was expelled from St Paul's Girls' School in London for throwing her school uniform over Hammersmith Bridge. Dickens then decided to go into service, despite coming from the privileged class; her experiences as a cook and general servant would form the nucleus of her first book, One Pair Of Hands, published in 1939. Dickens married an American Navy officer, Roy O. Stratton, and spent much of her adult life in Massachusetts and Washington D.C., but she continued to set the majority of her writing in Britain.

{"asin":"Hercule Poirot fans will be pleased to hear Hugh Fraser, who plays Captain Hastings on PBS'sMystery!and A&amp;E'sPoirot, recount Christie's intriguing 1948 novel (published in the U.S. asThere Is a Tide). The celebrated Belgian sleuth visits the sleepy English village of Warmsley Vale to check into the background of Gordon Cloade, supposedly a victim of the London Blitz. He had wed an attractive young widow, the former Mrs. Underhay, now the sole possessor of the Cloade family fortune. The deceased's sister-in-law told Poirot that \"spirits\" informed her that the widow's first husband is still among the living, raising suspicions about Cloade's demise. Fraser's tone at once reassures listeners that, just as on television, they are in capable hands. He does a fine job creating a variety of character voices, distinguishing one from another with clarity but without excessive flamboyance.

{"asin":"In each of the five stories in this stunning debut, Morazzoni meticulously charts the process of dying. Set in Europe during various historical periods, the beautifully cadenced tales depict moments of insight or deep emotion, illuminated with unusual clarity. In \"The White Door,\" she imagines the last, bitter days of Mozart, unable to finish his Requiem or communicate with his gay and talkative wife, even to play the card games he adores. Alone, and in the final dark, he laughs aloud. Less poignant, but equally brilliant in detail, is the title story, in which an art dealer, obsessed with beauty, takes an arduous journey from Scheveningen to Copenhagen to sell to a Danish nobleman the Vermeer painting he cherishes almost as much as money. After both men die, the nobleman's daughter offers to return the painting to the merchant's son, who has inherited only his father's interest in matters financial.

{"asin":"In his new book, Joseph Pearce asserts that the great poet, satirist, and playwright Oscar Wilde is as misunderstood today as he was in his own time. Vilified by his fellow Victorians for his sexuality and dandyism, these days he is hailed as a sexual liberator. Yet this is not how Wilde saw himself. His lifestyle and pretenses did not bring him happiness and fulfillment: his art did. And this is where Pearce's search for the man behind the masks is centered. Rather than lingering on the actions that brought him notoriety, Joseph Pearce explores the emotional and spiritual search of this fascinating and complex figure.The Unmasking of Oscar Wildereveals how his \"heart of stone\" was broken by his two-year prison sentence, while it probes the deeper implications of his masterpieces. Along with a discussion ofThe Ballad of Reading Gaoland the posthumously publishedDe Profundis,it also traces his fascination with Catholicism through to his eleventh-hour conversion.--This text refers to an out of print or unavailable edition of this title.","descriptionWord":["a","as","saw","himself.","His","lifestyle","and","pretenses","did","not","bring","him","happiness","and","fulfillment:","his","art","did.","And","this","is","where","Pearce's","unavailable","or","print","of","out","an","to","refers","text","conversion.--This","eleventh-hour","his","to","book,","new","his","In","through","Catholicism","with","fascination","his","traces","also","Profundis,it","publishedDe","posthumously","the","Gaoland","Reading","of","Ballad","ofThe","discussion","a","with","Along","Yet","this","is","today","misunderstood","as","is","Wilde","Oscar","playwright","and","satirist,","poet,","great","the","that","asserts","Pearce","Joseph","masterpieces.","his","of","implications","deeper","the","probes","it","while","sentence,","prison","title.","this","of","edition","and","spiritual","search","of","two-year","his","by","broken","was","stone\"","of","\"heart","his","how","Wildereveals","Oscar","of","Unmasking","figure.The","complex","and","fascinating","this","search","for","the","man","behind","the","masks","is","centered.","Rather","than","lingering","on","the","actions","that","brought","him","emotional","hailed","notoriety,","Joseph","Pearce","explores","the","as","he","was","in","his","own","time.","Vilified","by","his","fellow","Victorians","for","his","sexuality","and","dandyism,","these","days","he","is","not","how","Wilde","liberator.","sexual"]}
{"asin":"In pre-WW I Paris, Picasso, Debussy, Gide, Proust, Henri Bergson and Pierre and Marie Curie were among the creative minds who helped forge the modern world view of a subjective, fluid reality. Cronin's achievement in this scintillating, highly enjoyable social and cultural history is to demonstrate how the various endeavors of these and other groundbreakers were interrelated. France's adaptation to unless France really developed it.aa the motor car changed Proust's way of life. A new subjectivism, spurred by Bergson's spiritual philosophy, made possible Debussy's exploration of musical nuance, Picasso and Braque's invention of Cubism, and poet Charles Peguy's vision of a socialist utopia. Mingling gossip, biography and astute commentary, this chronicle tracks Diaghilev, Colette, Mattise and a host of others. Cronin, biographer of Napoleon, argues persuasively that Parisians' chilly rancor toward Germans stemmed in part from France's sense of national pride.

{"asin":"In this instructively focused tour of Chatto's celebrated gardens in Essex, England, the author demonstrates her guiding principles. Chatto's vision of gardening is defined by two influences: plant ecology (\"Plants have their preferences\") and Japanese garden design (\"Surprise elements are necessary; shock tactics are not\"). Chatto's passion is the play of shape, line and textureAwhich color may or may not enhance. But even more important is the garden's ecology of soil, light and air. After years of tracing garden plants back to their parents in the wild, Chatto knows the preferred growing conditions for individual species of perennials. This knowledge orders her gardens into habitats and her book into chapters: \"The Entrance Garden,\" \"The Water Garden,\" \"The Open Walks,\" \"The Shade Garden,\" \"The Dry Garden.\" Amid what seems a crowd of plants, each chapter spotlights one or two of Chatto's favorites, such as hellebores, waterside grasses, ferns, euphorbias and fritillarias. This feature, along with a plant guide at the end of the book (where useful lists of companion plants join individual plant profiles), accompanies the lush, abundant photographs.

Black Bart is a tyrant whose sexual appetite for young girls has forced him to flee the U.S. His troupe includes Lou-Ann Cooney, the \"comedy star,\" and Maw Cooney, the ultimate stage mother; the Cousins, a group of unsavory musicians; Uncle No'ccount; Crystal Harper, Black Bart's sister; and Sam Marcowitz, \"a man who could give wallpaper lessons on fading unobtrusively into the background,\" road manager and brother of Perkins & Tate's financial backer. When Maw Cooney is hurt in a dubious accident, then dies after exclaiming \"The bastard pushed me!\" Perkins is suspicious and apprehensive: He may know who the \"bastard\" is. Perkins and his partner Gerry Tate try unsuccessfully to keep the peace within Black Bart's group, but everyone seems determined to stir up more trouble.

{"asin":"Inspiration may be the most important element in the psyche of an artist. These volumes represent three widely different sources of inspiration, one from the spiritual world of Zen, another from the personal guidance of an accomplished mentor, and the last from the wildest reaches of the imagination. Carbonetti had a surprise hit with her first book, The Tao of Watercolor. This one may also find a wide audience, despite its rather superficial use of Zen. It is a bold attempt, but those seriously interested in Eastern religion as artistic inspiration will be disappointed. Howard is a master of light in both watercolor and oil. Appointed Official Artist in Northern Ireland and a member of the Royal Academy, he is a stimulating teacher with strong views. Going from the sublime to the hideous, Jefferies's book on fantasy art will either stimulate the imagination or provoke nightmares. His is one of the best manuals for creating beasts, angels, demons, wizards, and cursed castles. He even gives tips on making maps for lands where your creatures can roam.

Before long, holiday meals, lunches, suppers, and snacks appear, all an odd mixture of sophisticated and simple dishes, from fennel parmesan and oyster mushroom risotto to Father Christmas faces, many of which, unfortunately, contain quite a few ingredients (e.g., mangetouts, marmite) that should have been translated for American cooks.

{"asin":"Italy Today, the Beautiful Cookbookis the third volume on Italian cooking to join the popular Beautiful series of large format, lavishly illustrated books from HarperCollins. It is more than just a pretty book to set on the coffee table; this is a book cooks will enjoy and one that makes good reading if you are planning a trip to Italy.Fred Plotkin's text covers the history, economy, and particular ingredients important in each of Italy's culinary regions. He also explains how changes in the way Italians live are affecting how they eat. Meals, for example, now follow the traditional structure less rigidly in most parts of the country, with the southern areas holding closest to the old ways. Also, while cooking in Italy is still remarkably regional, people are enjoying recipes less tied to their locality. Use of fresh and local ingredients, however, remains strong.The recipes are by Lorenza De' Medici, who also did the food forItaly, the Beautiful CookbookandTuscany, the Beautiful Cookbook. Here she offers 220 dishes. Some show how Italians are modifying classics; others illustrate the living quality of Italian cooking in its acceptance of new ingredients and in new ways of using familiar ones. Perfect examples of this are Eggplant with Yogurt and Mint and Rice Salad with Pesto. Beyond all the handsome photographs, this is a source cooks really can use.","descriptionWord":["Salad","Rice","Italy","Today,","the","Beautiful","Cookbookis","the","third","volume","on","Italian","cooking","to","join","the","popular","Beautiful","series","of","large","format,","lavishly","illustrated","books","from","HarperCollins.","It","is","more","than","just","a","pretty","book","to","set","on","the","coffee","table;","this","is","a","book","cooks","will","enjoy","and","one","that","makes","good","reading","if","you","are","planning","a","trip","to","Italy.Fred","Plotkin's","text","covers","the","history,","economy,","and","particular","ingredients","important","in","each","of","Italy's","culinary","regions.","He","also","explains","how","changes","in","the","way","Italians","live","are","affecting","how","they","eat.","Meals,","for","example,","now","follow","the","traditional","structure","less","rigidly","in","most","parts","of","the","country,","with","the","southern","areas","holding","closest","to","the","old","ways.","Also,","while","cooking","in","Italy","is","still","remarkably","regional,","people","are","enjoying","recipes","less","tied","to","their","locality.","Use","of","fresh","and","local","ingredients,","however,","remains","strong.The","recipes","are","by","Lorenza","De'","Medici,","who","also","did","the","food","forItaly,","the","Beautiful","CookbookandTuscany,","the","Beautiful","Cookbook.","Here","she","offers","220","dishes.","Some","show","how","Italians","are","modifying","classics;","others","illustrate","the","living","quality","of","Italian","cooking","in","its","acceptance","of","new","ingredients","and","in","new","ways","of","using","familiar","ones.","Perfect","examples","of","this","are","Eggplant","with","Yogurt","and","Mint","and","use.","can","really","cooks","source","a","is","this","photographs,","handsome","the","all","Beyond","Pesto.","with"]}

{"asin":"Josh Spiller is a long-distance truck driver. Although his girlfriend  is pregnant, he's got no major personal problems--until the day he  rolls into a small town called Furnace, where a middle-aged woman  pushes a baby carriage straight into his wheels and then vanishes. The  dead baby's teenage mother and other passers-by swear the wind caused  the carriage to roll, and the police take Josh for a troublemaker when  he insists on writing a statement to the contrary. Shaken, Josh hits  the road again, only to find that it's not so easy to get away from  Furnace; something inhuman is hot on his heels.

{"asin":"Like the similar books about Australia, Hawaii, and Japan, each of these offers multiple photographic impressions recorded on a single day. Canada, for coverage of so vast a territory, engaged 100 international photographers (to Israelis ' mostly native 55), to produce 100,000 images (to Israelis ' 40,000), from which its several hundred memorable black-and-white and color illustrations were chosen. The photos juxtapose the industrial to the rural. A lively essay recounts experiences organizing the project and photographing on the actual day (June 8, 1984). The photographers get credit next to their pictures; a map shows where each worked that day; and a lengthy section gives their respective backgrounds, illustrated with past work. Israelis seems earnest, even somber, in comparison. With more than 300 equally fine images, it plays down the individual artists, presenting only a list of credits at the end. The introduction discusses not so much this project as the past and present social and political developments in this young nation, placing the images firmly in context. And indeed, throughout the coverage of agriculture, sheep, beaches, and apartment houses are the ubiquitous soldiers with guns. The heat and aridity are everywhere evident on this day (May 10, 1984) in the ``green'' month, before things are parched to brown. Both books use a chronological arrangement and tell when, to the hour, the pictures were taken, but Canada , being so large, offers maps on each page to show the geographical location of particular images. Both recommended for their candid presentation of ordinary daily life.

{"asin":"Long neglected, antique roses with their extravagantly blowzy flowers, quite unlike the tight-petaled blooms of their modern cousins, hybrid teas, are deservedly enjoying renewed popularity. These two titles by British rosarians are evidence of this trend. Scarman, owner of an English nursery that specializes in old-fashioned varieties, presents a beautifully illustrated directory of 150 roses as well as chapters on plant design, companion planting (with examples of innovative combinations), and basic care. Although Beales, a commercial rose grower and daughter of renowned old-rose specialist Peter Beales, intended her Rose Basics as a general guide to growing all types of roses, she features many heirloom roses worthy of cultivation. Particularly useful is the chapter on roses for difficult conditions, such as shade and poor soil; such information is often neglected in basic rose culture guides. Because both of these titles were written for a British audience, they lack specific critical advice for American gardeners, i.e., appropriate rose selection and care for the highly diverse climatic regions of the United States. For such information, readers should turn to Rayford Reddell's A Year in the Life of a Rose: A Guide to Growing Roses from Coast to Coast (LJ 11/15/96) or Judith McKeon's Encyclopedia of Roses: An Organic Guide to Growing America's Favorite Flower (LJ 9/1/95).

The book provides an overview of the entire civilization inspired by and reflecting the glory of the Sun King and so, while the character of Louis himself remains in the foreground, artists like Racine, Moliere, Lully and Mansart (the architect of Versailles) share the middle-ground with politicians such as Cardinal Mazarin and courtiers such as the King?s mistress, Louise de la Valliere.

Turner, a folklorist and lead singer in an all-women rock band, asserts that Madonna has invaded the psyches of women as a symbol of fearlessness, sexuality free of shame, and self-realization. The women whose dreams she records include homemakers, teenagers, grandmothers, a professor and a banker. Some dream of rescuing Madonna from danger; others dream of making love to her; in one dream the pop star is a policewoman. To most of the dreamers, Madonna is a sisterly companion or empowering friend.

{"asin":"Mermaids embody all that is beautiful, wondrous and cruel about  the sea, and in doing so have inspired adoration, fear and curiosity  since antiquity. As symbols of fertility, they are present in mythology  worldwide, from the creation myths of Tibet, China, Korea and India in  the East to the classical myth of the birth of Venus in the West. They  have long been the subject of popular sea ballads and chanties, and  have inspired works of music, literature and art by many a brilliant  soul, including Franz Joseph Haydn, Oscar Wilde, T.S. Eliot and Paul  Gaugin. A subject of feminist history and women's studies, mermaids  have been represented in popular culture in many forms: advertising,  music videos and successful Hollywood films.This lavish gift book,  replete with many special features, including vellum pages, metallic  ink, an enchanting gatefold, a fortune-telling mermaid and a mermaid  tattoo, is a tactile, enticing trip under the sea. Author Theodore  Gachot discusses the archetypal appeal and multifaceted symbolism of  the mermaid -- as goddess, heroine, fertility symbol and ocean spirit  -- throughout time and across cultures. A range of stunning artwork and  excerpts from literature enhance every alluring page, while a  comprehensive sources section enables readers to locate mermaid art and  decorative accessories.","descriptionWord":["and","and","have","inspired","works","of","music,","literature","and","art","by","many","a","brilliant","soul,","including","Franz","Joseph","Haydn,","Oscar","Wilde,","T.S.","Eliot","and","Paul","Gaugin.","A","subject","of","feminist","history","and","women's","studies,","mermaids","have","been","represented","in","popular","culture","in","many","forms:","advertising,","music","videos","and","successful","Hollywood","films.This","lavish","gift","book,","replete","with","many","special","features,","including","vellum","pages,","metallic","ink,","an","enchanting","gatefold,","a","fortune-telling","mermaid","and","a","mermaid","tattoo,","is","a","tactile,","enticing","trip","under","the","sea.","Author","Theodore","Gachot","discusses","the","archetypal","appeal","and","multifaceted","symbolism","of","the","mermaid","--","as","goddess,","heroine,","fertility","symbol","and","ocean","spirit","--","throughout","time","and","across","cultures.","A","range","of","stunning","artwork","and","excerpts","from","literature","enhance","every","alluring","page,","while","a","comprehensive","sources","section","enables","readers","to","locate","mermaid","art","and","decorative","accessories.","chanties,","Mermaids","embody","all","that","is","beautiful,","wondrous","and","cruel","about","the","sea,","and","in","doing","so","have","inspired","adoration,","fear","and","curiosity","since","antiquity.","As","symbols","of","fertility,","they","are","present","in","mythology","worldwide,","from","the","creation","myths","of","Tibet,","China,","Korea","and","India","in","the","East","to","the","classical","myth","of","the","birth","of","Venus","in","the","West.","They","have","long","been","the","subject","of","popular","sea","ballads"]}

{"asin":"Murder will out, and does, in this latest addition (after 2000's An Enigmatic Disappearance) to the long-running and well-loved Inspector Alvarez series. Set as usual on Jeffries's home island of Mallorca, it features fair-play detection and (more importantly) keen observation of the human species. When the body of a retired Bolivian diplomat is found floating facedown in his swimming pool, Alvarez suspects the death was no accident. When he begins receiving calls threatening his life if he doesn't drop the case, he knows he's on the right trail. Then the unexpected occurs, proving family bonds are stronger than bureaucratic torpor. The simpatico Alvarez bases his conclusions not on fantastic deductions or painstaking forensic evidence but on patient and profound insight into the human soul. Like Maigret, he savors a case, displaying tolerant bemusement at human foibles. (\"Why did modern youth enjoy hairstyles which made them look as if they were suffering from alopecia?\") In addition, there are nice touches of local color throughout. (\"The bay backed by mountains and marshland, the cerulean sea, and the curving beaches of sand, pebbles, or rock, were still beautiful despite the marina, flats, restaurants and stores selling kitschy goods and the holiday camp which looked as if it had been designed by a French bureaucrat.\") In sum, the style is pleasing, the detection inspired and the novel, as a whole, sometimes tragic but never dispiriting.Copyright 2001 Cahners Business Information, Inc.--This text refers to an out of print or unavailable edition of this title.","descriptionWord":["if","as","look","them","made","which","hairstyles","enjoy","youth","modern","did","(\"Why","foibles.","human","at","bemusement","tolerant","displaying","case,","a","savors","he","Maigret,","Like","soul.","human","the","into","insight","profound","and","patient","on","but","evidence","forensic","painstaking","or","deductions","fantastic","on","not","conclusions","his","bases","Alvarez","simpatico","The","torpor.","bureaucratic","than","is","are","bonds","family","proving","occurs,","unexpected","the","Then","trail.","right","the","on","he's","knows","he","case,","the","drop","doesn't","he","if","life","his","threatening","calls","receiving","begins","he","When","accident.","no","was","death","the","suspects","Alvarez","pool,","swimming","his","in","facedown","floating","found","is","diplomat","Bolivian","retired","a","of","body","the","When","species.","human","the","of","observation","keen","importantly)","(more","and","detection","fair-play","features","it","Mallorca,","of","island","home","Jeffries's","on","usual","as","Set","series.","Alvarez","Inspector","well-loved","and","long-running","the","to","Disappearance)","Enigmatic","An","2000's","(after","addition","latest","this","in","does,","and","out,","will","Murder","never","but","tragic","sometimes","whole,","a","as","novel,","the","and","inspired","detection","the","dispiriting.Copyright","2001","Cahners","Business","Information,","Inc.--This","text","refers","to","an","out","of","print","or","unavailable","edition","of","this","title.","pleasing,","stronger","bureaucrat.\")","In","sum,","the","style","French","a","by","designed","been","had","it","if","as","looked","which","camp","holiday","the","and","goods","kitschy","selling","stores","and","restaurants","flats,","marina,","the","despite","beautiful","still","were","rock,","or","pebbles,","sand,","of","beaches","curving","the","and","sea,","cerulean","the","marshland,","and","mountains","by","backed","bay","(\"The","throughout.","color","local","of","touches","nice","are","there","addition,","In","alopecia?\")","from","suffering","were","they"]}

The photos show us villages and farms and take us into homes, schools and factories. From a kaleidoscope of images--rice-planting brigades, a defendant in the dock on trial for murder, yaks on Main Street in one city--we get a feel for the contradictions and pressures of a modernizing society. Many of the photos are exceptionally beautiful; taken together, they reveal the diversity of this vast country, moving from the tent-like yurts of Mongolian nomads to a Tantric Buddhist monastery in occupied Tibet. The photo-essay concludes with a glimpse of protest posters that went up at Beijing University as students began to occupy Tiananmen Square, a tragically ironic conclusion in light of events that followed.

He was born in Abyssinia (Ethiopia) to British diplomatic parents who were friends of Emperor Haile Selassie. Thesiger remembers Addis Ababa, the capital, as a village with grass huts, no roads and colorful ceremonies. He attended Eton and Oxford, then returned to Africa for the first of many journeys, exploring the Awash River (home to the dreaded Danakil, whose warriors killed randomly to prove their manhood and collected their victims' genitals for trophies). As a district officer in the Sudan Political Service, Thesiger had further opportunities to travel in desert lands and meet nomadic tribes. During World War II, he served with Orde Wingate's troops, liberating Abyssinia from the Italians; later, he fought behind the lines in the Western Desert. In addition to superb adventure, Thesiger gives a fine portrait of the waning days of the British Empire in the Sudan and of the last revolution in Ethiopia.

Next, she demands her potty (while squeezing toothpaste all over the cat). Finally, she remembers to say the magic word when she requests her teddy bear. Then, on a walk, she encounters a big, red-nosed blue Beastie. He pitches a fit about wanting his dinner, and the Little Princess tells him to say please.

{"asin":"Provence is loved for its sunlit beauty and earthy, tantalizing cuisine. Both are celebrated inProvence the Beautiful Cookbook, an oversized (more than two feet tall!) picture and cookbook of breathtaking color photos and authentic regional recipes. The 270 recipes, compiled and written by award-winning food book authorRichard Olney, include soups and starters; seafood, meat, game, and poultry dishes; vegetable and grain specialties; and simple but luscious desserts. Readers seeking an armchair tour of the region, singularly depicted, and the chance to see and reproduce its dishes, will delight in the book, which would also make a welcome gift.Beginning with an introduction to the land and its cooking, the book then weaves short essays about the Proven&#xE7;al regions with recipes arranged by courses. There are exemplary versions of bouillabaisse and bourride (the creamy, garlic-infused fish chowder), estouffade (braised beef, here with olives and mushrooms), daubs (stews), vegetable-filled omelets, and tians (savory gratins). Less familiar treasures include a mixed herb pasta from Alpes-de-Haute-Provence, porgy with crab sauce from the Var, a braised stuffed lamb shoulder from Vaucluse, zucchini and rice gratin from the Alpes Maritimes, and dried figs in thyme and red wine syrup, also from the Var. The recipes reflect Olney's unerring palate and dedication to tradition; some cooks may find certain dishes beyond their reach, but all will discover approachable recipes that are easily made.

{"asin":"Recipe collection, travelogue, history lesson and art book, the 13th of the publisher's Beautiful Cookbooks may be the most ambitious, and is surely among the most accomplished of the series. IACP and James Beard Foundation Award-winner Goldstein (Back to Square One; Festive Occasions) has exercised masterful selection skills to balance this sampling of 250 recipes from a region that supports a wealth of culinary traditions, including southern Italian, Provencal France and coastal Spain; Turkey, the Middle East and northern Africa; Greece and the Balkans. Food scholar Ayla Aygar's comprehensive essay on the culinary and geo-political history of the Mediterranean region introduces the seven chapters, which are organized around courses and types of dishes, and feature recipes from each culinary tradition. Interspersed among chapters are shorter essays discussing the culinary heritage of each region. The recipes, which generally suggest variations found in other countries (and are an etymologist's delight), are uncomplicated, gracefully written, accessible to the American home cook and highlight the area's abundance of vegetables and fish. Of particular note are the chapters on soups and fish, ranging from the simplicity of Turkish grilled swordfish to Sicilian stuffed squid, and including four variations on a Moroccan fish marinade. With 250 photographs, this volume is also a feast for the eye.

Two days after the funeral of her husband, Frank, Ellie feels immobilized by grief. Then the respectable Mrs. Dawes rushes to Ellie's door to announce she's just discovered the body of a young man at the church altar. Ellie soon becomes involved in the mystery surrounding the victim's murder, the subsequent disappearance of his mother and the disturbing quarrels of the young couple next door. Simultaneously, she examines her own life and, with a new confidence and strength, is able to stand up to Frank's bullying aunt Drusilla and her own spoiled daughter, Diana. Life without Frank will not be as predictable and safe, but it will certainly be more exciting. Heley's keen observations and insights into her characters create a rich atmosphere of the social life in an English town where, as reflected in the inviting pastoral jacket illustration, folk work in the local charity shop, go to the greengrocers and stop for sausages and mash at the Sunflowers caf . Combining sparkling wit and humor (particularly regarding Ellie's first attempts to master the computer), quirky acts of fate and a dramatic ending, Heley provides all one needs for a satisfying read, except perhaps a cozy chair, a cup of tea and some chocolate biscuits.

{"asin":"Some things you just don't outgrow. Take Roy Rogers. Yes, the idea of singing cowboys is about as silly as fried Spam sandwiches, but if you were 10 once and watched Roy, Dale, and Trigger cavort on the big screen (or, later, on television), there's probably still a part of you that can't hear \"Happy Trails to You\" without feeling a wee bit wistful. You'll feel more than that after browsing through this nostalgia-soaked photo-biography. Combining wonderful vintage photographs with a brief autobiographical narrative from Roy himself, the book chronicles the storybook life of one Leonard Slye, a Depression-era teenager when his family left their Ohio farm for a dust-bowl journey to California. Only a few short years later, Leonard had become Roy Rogers, \"King of the Cowboys,\" and was launched on a career that would encompass 81 movies, a TV series, and hundreds of radio performances and recordings. The success of Roy Rogers says a lot about the U.S. during the Depression and throughout World War II, but it says even more about the wide eyes of kids everywhere at anytime.

{"asin":"Sporting arresting covers, a snappy layout with handsome, glossy photographs and a neat conceit, this series of four slender volumes offers considerably less in the way of practical information. McDonald, garden editor of Houston Life, provides beautiful pictures of blooms, foliage and fruits, accompanied by brief sections of text written in an authoritative, somewhat off-putting prose that tends toward hyperbole: \"Roses have set the standard for redness from the beginning of recorded history.\" In each volume, the color range is quite broad, so that Red embraces the \"rose-purple spikes\" of the obedience plant and the yellow-orange brilliance of the Gloriosa daisy, while the silver foliage of dusty miller is included in Blue. Unquestionably pretty to look through-the photos were taken mainly at nurseries and public and private gardens in the U.S., Canada and England-and likely to spark ideas in a gardener's mind, the volumes nevertheless disappoint by scanting such crucial considerations as appropriate planting zones (the flowers featured tend to favor hot climates) and other plant-specific requirements. Each volume includes a packet of containing three or four varieties of color-selected seeds, enough for a 1'35' \"border\" (i.e., two windowboxes).

{"asin":"Steven Spielberg is pretty much America's official dream merchant, building upon the legacy of previous cultural fantasists such as Frank Capra and Walt Disney. \"The first appeal of [an American popular artwork] is, and must be,\" says Baxter, \"commonplace delight,\" at which Spielberg excels. \"His films . . . are machines for delighting us,\" Baxter continues and then tells us how those machines are put together. Exploring the filmmaking, a portrait of the filmmaker emerges. Spielberg, notably comfortable with the idea that a hiqh-quality motion picture can be entertaining and vice versa, has met with so much commercial success that his artistic successes may be overlooked. Examining Spielberg's career film by film, Baxter redresses any lack of appreciation for the man's artistry and produces an excellent book about the contemporary director who just may have the best cumulative record of achievement to stand upon in public and declare himself to be \"king of the world\" --of popular culture, that is.Mike Tribby--This text refers to an out of print or unavailable edition of this title.","descriptionWord":["any","redresses","Baxter","film,","versa,","vice","and","entertaining","be","can","picture","motion","unavailable","or","print","of","out","an","to","refers","text","Tribby--This","is.Mike","that","culture,","popular","--of","world\"","the","of","\"king","be","to","himself","declare","and","public","in","cultural","is,","upon","stand","to","achievement","previous","of","legacy","the","upon","building","hiqh-quality","a","that","idea","the","with","comfortable","notably","Spielberg,","emerges.","filmmaker","the","of","portrait","a","filmmaking,","the","Exploring","together.","put","of","record","cumulative","merchant,","dream","official","America's","much","pretty","is","best","the","have","fantasists","such","as","Frank","Capra","and","Walt","Disney.","\"The","first","may","just","who","director","contemporary","appeal","of","[an","and","must","be,\"","says","Baxter,","\"commonplace","delight,\"","at","which","Spielberg","excels.","\"His","films","American","Spielberg","Steven","the","about","book","excellent","an","produces","and","artistry","man's","popular","artwork]","title.","this",".",".",".","are","machines","for","delighting","us,\"","Baxter","continues","and","then","tells","us","how","those","machines","are","by","film","of","edition","career","Spielberg's","Examining","overlooked.","be","may","successes","artistic","his","that","success","commercial","much","so","with","met","has","the","for","appreciation","of","lack"]}

{"asin":"Sturgis proved to be an exceptional artist's biographer inAubrey Beardsley(1999), and he now presents a substantial but ever-lively life of the questing British painter Sickert (1860-1942), whom Sturgis succinctly describes as \"a great man and a great artist.\" Charming and mischievous, Sickert enjoyed a happy childhood, a stint as an actor that inspired his scandalous music-hall paintings, and marriage to a woman willing to support him even after they divorced because of his many affairs. Sickert's notorious sexual escapades run the gamut from romantic to pragmatic to farcical. Profoundly inspired by James McNeil Whistler and Degas, Sickert became a leader among radical British painters, an influential art critic, and a teacher. Sturgis' glowing portrait stands in stark opposition to crime writer Patricia Cornwell's extravagant claim inPortrait of a Killer(2002) that Sickert was Jack the Ripper. Indeed, Sturgis makes short work of Cornwell's allegations after fully substantiating his portrait of Sickert as a revered artist whose joie de vivre, \"rare power of objective vision,\" frankness, and intensity revitalized the British figurative tradition.Donna SeamanCopyright &#169; American Library Association.

Marshall casts a wide net, gathering all traces of antiauthoritarian socialist thought in works from Lao Tzu through Noam Chomsky, social ecology, and the Zapatistas. Readers will be repeatedly rewarded by Marshall's judiciousness and close readings of both the great names in anarchist history&mdash;Proudhon, Kropotkin, and Tolstoy&mdash;and less expected contributors&mdash;Rousseau, Swift, and Burke. Blowing away cobwebs of misunderstanding and misrepresentation, this is a stimulating portrait of a highly varied but distinctive political ideal, tradition, and practice arising from the enduring human impulse to be free.(June)Copyright &copy; Reed Business Information, a division of Reed Elsevier Inc.

{"asin":"The greatest arms race in history began in the first years of  the 20th century as World Powers expanded their fleets. Germany  challenged the Royal Navy's global dominance, the U.S. and Japan  established themselves as major naval powers. The revolutionaryHMS  Dreadnoughtwas succeeded by even larger and more powerful warships  that clashed spectacularly at the battle of Jutland in 1916. Plans for  a new generation of &#39;super dreadnoughts&#39; were delayed by  international treaties, but Japanese ambitions eventually led to a new  arms race with the U.S.. This naval race produced the world&#39;s  largest and most heavily-armed battleships, like theYamotoandOwa. Combat experience in World War II soon revealed that  submarines and aircraft posed a lethal threat to even the greatest  battleship. Only the U.S. Navy had the resources to maintain a  battleship force after 1945, and these mighty warships have attached  enemy coasts from Vietnam and the Lebanon to the 1991 Gulf War.Acclaimed naval illustrator Tony Gibbons has painted all classes of  twentieth century battleship forJane&#39;s Battleships of the 20th  Century. Every major battleship is shown in profile, with the 25  greatest battleships illustrated across the full width of the page,  with accompanying plan and bow views.Naval historian Bernard  Ireland reveals the fascinating background to each class of battleship.

{"asin":"The new HarperCollins \"Learn To Draw\" series contains more than a dozen slim, inexpensive volumes, each devoted to a single genre. Cook's book on buildings is a good introduction to basic drawing tools and materials, with brief demonstrations and tips. The volume suffers from the smallness of many of the illustrations and the resulting loss of detail. An earlier effort by Michael Woods, The Complete Drawing Course: How You Can Master All the Techniques of Drawing in Just 25 Minutes (Batsford, 1995) is broader in scope and a better value. For those who want to render buildings in watercolor, Taylor's book is an unequivocal success. A member of the Society of Architectural Illustrators, Taylor has created a sumptuous work, rich in detailed images, and, moreover, complete with a brilliant text. For readers who wonder how a particular shadow is splashed over a stucco wall or how to get small panes in sunlight to look like real glass, Taylor reveals the color values and techniques necessary.

{"asin":"This affectionate, almost loving portrait of two of Britain's most distinguished and controversial artists is made all the more poignant by the fact that the biographer, art journalist and author Daniel Farson, died while writing it. Being about Gilbert & George, the salacious material is fairly unorthodox--the most shocking revelation is that George married as a young man and has two children--and for the most part Farson is almost apologetic about any intrusion into Proesch and Passmore's (their surnames) private lives. The first half of the book takes us from their childhoods in the Dolomites and Tiverton via their meeting at St. Martin's School of Art in the late 1960s to their current status as art icons. The second half sees Farson following them around--Moscow, Shanghai, Barnstable--as they exhibit around the world. Farson wisely highlights his admiration at the outset, and the reader is clear that this is no hatchet job. That said, he covers both the art and the lives with a straightforward professionalism that is never less than absorbing. This book is a fine tribute to Gilbert & George; equally, their closing words are a fine tribute to Farson: \"On 27 November our dear Daniel died, not knowing how much we loved him (though we told him often enough).\"--Nick Wroe","descriptionWord":["of","School","Martin's","St.","at","meeting","their","via","Tiverton","and","Dolomites","the","that","in","childhoods","their","from","us","takes","book","the","of","half","first","The","lives.","private","surnames)","(their","Passmore's","and","Proesch","into","the","more","poignant","by","the","fact","that","the","biographer,","art","journalist","and","author","Daniel","Farson,","most","the","for","children--and","two","has","any","about","apologetic","almost","and","man","young","a","as","married","George","that","is","revelation","shocking","most","unorthodox--the","fairly","is","material","salacious","the","George,","&","Gilbert","about","Being","it.","writing","while","died","intrusion","is","all","made","is","artists","controversial","and","distinguished","most","Britain's","of","two","of","portrait","loving","almost","affectionate,","This","Farson","part","Wroe","enough).\"--Nick","often","him","told","we","(though","him","loved","we","much","how","knowing","not","died,","Daniel","dear","our","November","27","\"On","Farson:","to","tribute","fine","a","are","words","closing","their","equally,","George;","&","Gilbert","to","tribute","fine","a","is","book","This","absorbing.","than","less","never","is","that","professionalism","straightforward","a","with","lives","the","and","art","the","both","covers","he","said,","That","job.","hatchet","no","is","this","clear","is","reader","the","and","outset,","the","at","admiration","his","highlights","wisely","Farson","world.","the","around","exhibit","they","Barnstable--as","Shanghai,","around--Moscow,","them","following","Farson","sees","half","second","The","icons.","art","as","status","current","their","to","1960s","late","the","in","Art"]}

{"asin":"This is a lively if superficial overview of the lives and times of Princess Diana's illustrious family through 500 years, from the Tudor age to the present. Gaining and losing vast fortunes; making shrewd, status-enhancing marriages; and jockeying for social and political power are the recurring themes of this family saga, whose subjects rose from being wealthy farmers during the reign of Henry VII to ranking among the most prosperous and prominent families in the land by the 18th century, only to see both their wealth and their status decline throughout the Victorian and contemporary eras--until Diana, third daughter of the eighth earl, made her \"fairy-tale\" marriage into the royal family. Including such notables as Sarah Churchill and the infamous 18th-century duchess of Marlborough, whose carefully calculated scheming made the family one of the richest in the land, the Spencer clan is replete with colorful characters. That Princess Diana herself drew strength from this ancestral heritage, as Pearson claims, is undoubtable; more dubious, however, are his repeated assertions that various facets of Diana's own character are direct inheritances from one ancestor or another. This suggestion that biology is destiny culminates in the proposition--based on the observation that Princes William and Harry look more like their mother than their father--that the Spencer genes have superseded those of the Windsors and will be instrumental in shaping the future of the British monarchy. While this claim that the Spencer family history yields vital insights into the destinies of Diana and her children seems somewhat overstated, those who admire the late princess of Wales and those who are drawn to accounts of English dynastic history will find the story of the Spencers engrossing.

{"asin":"This isn't at all the carefree story implied by the title and cover artwork--terminal cancer, AIDS, gay-bashing and death are treated tenderly here, in appropriate middle-reader fashion. Colin Mudford, an Australian boy, suspects that his parents favor his younger brother, Luke. When Luke collapses suddenly and is hospitalized, Colin wistfully imagines he has a malady of his own. Yet upon hearing that Luke will die of cancer, Colin sets out to find a doctor to cure him. Sent to live with relatives in England, Colin first tries soliciting the Queen's help, then approaches hospital physicians. He eventually meets Ted, a homosexual whose lover is dying of AIDS. Colin and Ted support one another through a difficult time (including Ted's assault by homophobic thugs), which enables Colin to shed his self-centered ways and allow a brave, resourceful and loving person to emerge.

British spymaster Tweed thinks one of his four European section chiefs is a double agent and possibly a sadistic mass murderer. Tweed treks to Germany, where one of his top agents was killed, obviously betrayed by the traitor. The Russians and East Germans, hoping to kill Tweed, lead him to Lubeck, home of mysterious philanthropist Dr. Berlin. Deliberately using himself as bait to flush the two-faced \"Janus,\" Tweed is saved from assassination in Lubeck only with the help of British agent Bob Newman. Eventually Tweed uncovers a Russian plotfostered by a tough-talking Gorbachevto flood England with heroin, which the Soviets assume will destroy the country. The interminable comings and goings of Tweed and Newman, one in England, the other in East Germany, are chronicled in clumsy prose, often like a bad translation (\"She moved agilely but with grace.\") and unintentionally funny \"Cunning as a fox, Markus Wolf.\").

{"asin":"To judge by this densely textured and occasionally exciting suspense novel, China after Mao is still a dangerous place to be, especially for those in power. The protagonist, Hong, is a high-ranking policeman whose stubborn honesty leads him to investigate, unofficially and at growing personal risk, the mysterious death of his friend and mentor, while at the same time he is officially tailing a visiting American psychiatrist presumed to be a spy. Hong's investigations take him on a journey through the past that ends with his expose of treachery and crime among Mao's closest associates, the \"tigers\" of the Revolution. The novel's chief strengths are its intensely realistic depiction of a Peking bureaucracy, wherein those with the strongest noses for \"spiritual pollution\" appear to be the most corrupt, and Hong himself, a sympathetic and credible figure caught in the toils of sordid events. Its weaknesses are a pedestrian style and characterization that, Hong aside, is somewhat lacking in depth and vibrancy. Nathan wrote Rising Higher and Amusement Park.

{"asin":"Veering from absurdist farce to social satire, this dazzlingly inventive, entertaining novel from Swedish author Lindgren (Light) plays relentlessly upon the theme of authenticity and artifice, illusion and reality. After picture framer/art dealer Theodor Marklund buys at auction The Madonna with the Dagger, this high-priced symbolic canvas, painted in 1919, is confiscated by tax officials. But then a shady art collector known only as \"Goatee\" returns the painting?or a forgery?to Markland. Others lay claim to The Madonna, including the son of the woman who posed for it, and Marklund's greedy ex-girlfriend. As Marklund's life spins into in a web of falsehood and deception, a similar fate befalls his friend Paula, a pop-music superstar who is having an affair with her plastic surgeon. Nothing is what it appears to be?not The Madonna itself, nor Marklund's artificial hand, nor the presumed suicide of Paula's manager, whom she may have pushed out the window. Loaded with scattershot allusions to Heidegger, Dali, Madonna, Baudelaire, Bach, Schopenhauer and Barbara Cartland, this post-Pop fable spoofs the mass media's fabrication of reality as it ponders the abyss between modern art and life.Copyright 1995 Reed Business Information, Inc.--This text refers to an out of print or unavailable edition of this title.","descriptionWord":["canvas,","in","1919,","is","confiscated","by","tax","officials.","But","then","a","shady","art","collector","known","only","as","\"Goatee\"","returns","the","painting?or","a","forgery?to","Markland.","Others","lay","claim","to","The","Madonna,","including","the","son","Nothing","surgeon.","plastic","her","with","affair","an","having","is","who","of","the","woman","who","posed","for","it,","and","Marklund's","greedy","ex-girlfriend.","As","Marklund's","life","spins","into","in","a","web","of","falsehood","and","deception,","a","superstar","pop-music","a","Paula,","friend","his","befalls","fate","similar","The","Madonna","itself,","nor","Marklund's","artificial","hand,","nor","window.","the","out","pushed","have","may","she","whom","manager,","Paula's","of","suicide","presumed","the","painted","title.","this","of","edition","unavailable","or","print","of","out","an","to","refers","text","Inc.--This","Information,","Business","Reed","1995","life.Copyright","and","art","modern","between","abyss","the","ponders","it","as","reality","of","fabrication","media's","mass","the","spoofs","fable","post-Pop","this","Cartland,","Barbara","and","Schopenhauer","Bach,","Baudelaire,","Madonna,","Dali,","Heidegger,","to","allusions","scattershot","with","Loaded","be?not","to","appears","it","what","is","Veering","from","absurdist","farce","to","social","satire,","this","dazzlingly","inventive,","entertaining","novel","from","Swedish","author","Lindgren","(Light)","plays","relentlessly","upon","the","theme","of","authenticity","and","artifice,","illusion","and","reality.","After","picture","framer/art","dealer","Theodor","Marklund","buys","at","auction","The","Madonna","with","the","Dagger,","this","high-priced","symbolic"]}

{"asin":"Waldrone ( Cold Spaghetti at Midnight ) here finds redeeming value in a humble thing, traipsing with the potato through culinary Mexico, France, Italy, Hungary, the Middle East and various quarters of North America. As glimpsed through the fine nostalgic mist of Jones's camera, the root swells a Mediterranean fish stew; stuffs golden fowl or green chilies; or lies au naturel , pending baking or roasting. Among the most appealing recipes are the simplest: in roasted balsamic potatoes and onions, recommended as an accompaniment to red meats, the contenders are oven-roasted first in olive oil and then in seasoned balsamic vinegar; in rosemary potato skewers, potato chunks are boiled, dredged in herbs and spices, and grilled on charcoal. But if the potato lends itself to these visceral pleasures, it can also sneak into upper-crust tarts without suffering. (And even into hummus--where, one suspects, it may languish.) Waldron, trained at La Varenne, offers appetizers, side dishes and main courses in her brief book, a new entry in Collins's attractive Country Garden Cookbook series, and even offers advice to the amateur grower--but omits desserts, where potatoes can give depth and moist substance, if not pungence, to tortes.

{"asin":"While many readers are familiar with SIR GAWAIN AND THE GREEN KNIGHT (and perhaps even Tolkien's translation), these poems from the same fourteenth-century manuscript are less well known. PEARL the longer of the two, is an elegy for the poet's baby daughter, told in alliterative verse. SIR ORFEO is a Celtic version of the Greek myth of Orpheus and Eurydice, complete with a happy ending that the older story lacks. Terry Jones, former member of Monty Python and a medieval scholar to boot, sounds perfectly comfortable with the rhythms and language. One even gets a taste of the original Middle English on the final side, when Jones puts these works into context by reading Tolkien's own introductions.

{"asin":"Why would a soldier fight someone else's war? Is it the money, or a desire to help the underdog? Or is a fire fight the ultimate thrill? Based on extensive interviews with mercenaries of many nationalities,Someone Else's Warreveals the motivations of these modern \"soldiers of fortune\" and the incredible risks they take. The book first looks at how white mercenaries came to play a key role in the struggle for the Congo in the 1960s, and how the end of the war in Vietnam coincided with the start of the war in Rhodesia, attracting a new generation of mercenary soldiers. The story moves on from the Angolan debacle of 1976, to a succession of operations in Africa and South America, and on to the Balkan conflict. Written by a former mercenary, this hard-hitting account shoots down the Hollywood stereotypes.--This text refers to an out of print or unavailable edition of this title.","descriptionWord":["an","to","refers","text","stereotypes.--This","Hollywood","the","down","shoots","account","hard-hitting","this","mercenary,","former","a","by","Written","conflict.","Balkan","the","to","on","and","America,","South","and","Africa","in","operations","of","succession","a","to","1976,","of","debacle","Angolan","the","from","on","moves","story","The","soldiers.","mercenary","of","generation","new","a","attracting","Rhodesia,","in","war","the","of","start","the","with","coincided","Vietnam","in","war","the","of","end","the","how","and","1960s,","the","Why","would","a","soldier","fight","someone","else's","war?","Is","it","the","money,","or","a","desire","to","help","the","underdog?","Or","is","a","fire","fight","the","ultimate","thrill?","Based","on","extensive","interviews","with","mercenaries","of","many","nationalities,Someone","Else's","Warreveals","the","motivations","of","these","modern","\"soldiers","of","fortune\"","and","the","incredible","risks","they","take.","The","book","first","looks","at","how","white","mercenaries","came","to","play","a","key","role","in","the","struggle","for","the","Congo","in","title.","this","of","edition","unavailable","or","print","of","out"]}
{"asin":"Widely known in Canada from hisMontreal Gazettecolumn, and work with the Discovery Channel, Schwarcz (Let Them Eat Flax) is an entertaining guide through the tangle of conflicting research studies, advertising claims, special interest groups, age-old myths and popular opinion that make diet a cloudy subject. In short chapters he aims his microscope at such highly touted foods as tomatoes, acai berries, curry and soy; additives like nitrites, artificial sweeteners, vitamins and fluoride; contaminants including pesticides, hormones, trans fats and dioxins; and what, for him, are suspect fads. Schwarcz contends that while there are no magical foods, a diet of mostly vegetables, fruits, whole grains and low-fat dairy products and moderation are key to good health. To help readers make informed choices, he ably cuts through many controversies and will likely stir up a few (he challenges those who condemn milk consumption, espouse detoxification and promote kosher foods, for example). Schwarcz makes learning fun by peppering his text with fascinating facts (coffee contains naturally occurring carcinogens, and apples have formaldehyde). More importantly, he leaves readers with a rational framework for evaluating the complex nature of foods and how they affect health.(Jan.)Copyright &copy; Reed Business Information, a division of Reed Elsevier Inc.
